# MyFlickrSearchApp

## What is MyFlickrSearchApp?
This app is the result of a programming assignment with as task to write an app you think is production ready that works as a client app for Flickr.

## Requirements

### Functional requirements
1. the app must use the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) to allow user searching for photos with specific words
2. the app must show the results of the search in an infinite scroll list where each cell contains at least a photo
3. when tapping on a cell the user of the app must see the full screen photo and its details

### Non-functional requirements
1. The deliverable must include the full project and a README.txt file describing how to build it and other relevant informations
2. Any third party library can be used. The README.txt must contain a brief description of the library and the reason it is used.
3. Android apps must be built using Java or Kotlin. iOS must be built using Objective-C or Swift
4. Even though the app is not an exercise of design, the app must show common UI paradigms of the platform
5. Within the requirements thereâ€™s complete freedom to be creative and add details

# Release history

## Version 1.0 Build 1

### Description
First version, with very basic functionality up and running. It is possible to search for photos with specific keywords. The results of a search are displayed in an infinite scroll list where each cell contains the title and a photo. When tapping on a cell, the user can see the full screen photo with zoom and pan possibilities. Details of the photo are not retrieved in this version.

### Not fullfilled requirements:
* Details of the picture are not retrieved

### Added details:
* Panning and zooming in detailled view

### Known limitations:
* There is no feedback to the user, when e.g. the search didn't return any photo's or for any other error
* Unit test cover only one very basic class

### Future enhancements: 
* Move model into a framework which is used by the application
* Memory management: only keep information cached which is visible and a few pages before and after view instead of reducing memory (i.e. throw all retrieved pages away) on a low memory warning - note that the Flickr search api returns at most the first 4.000 results and as we don't story the pictures, memory usage is not that high
* Code to retrieve minitures and full pictures is very simular, could be make a more generic function?

# Building the App

## Build environment
* XCode Version 8.1 (8B62), running on macOS Sierra version 10.12.1

## Used libraries
* Apple: essential Frameworks to build an iOS app
 * UIKit: See [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit) for more information
 * Foundation: See [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation) for more information
* Other: none
 * Other frameworks are not included because in such a simple app as this one they would only increase the project's complexity and dependencies. When sticking to the Apple Frameworks, maintainebility will be easier.
 * Flickr API Kits for Objective-C are available, but outdated and also would only increase the project's complexity and dependencies.
 
## Deployement target
* iOS 10.1
* Devices: iPhone
